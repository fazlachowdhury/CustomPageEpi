Problems faces:
	# After Installing packages, saw server error while debuggin. Updating EPiDatabase solved the problem.
	# Form tab not showing in assets pane:
		Steps: 1. Restarted the process, didn't solve issue
		       2. Restarted the Visual Studio, didn't solve issue
		       3. Used Epi community solution: Edit -> profile -> my Settings -> display options tab -> click reset views button. Worked like a charm :D
